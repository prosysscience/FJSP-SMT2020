The Answer Set Programming (ASP) modulo difference logic encodings and instances presented in the PADL 2023 paper [Flexible Job-shop Scheduling for Semiconductor Manufacturing with Hybrid Answer Set Programming (Application Paper)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24841-2_6) are provided in the [PADL-2023 folder](PADL-2023/README.md).

Our implementation extending the former work by partially flexible machine assignment strategies, batch processing, and multi-objective optimization is contained in the [Multi-objective_Optimization folder](Multi-objective_Optimization/README.md).
